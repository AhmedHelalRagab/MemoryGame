# MemoryGame
### This is a simple memory game implemented in JavaScript. The game presents a grid of cards, and the player's objective is to match pairs of cards with the same symbol by flipping them over. The game keeps track of the number of tries the player has made.
#### How to Play
When the game starts, you will be prompted to enter your name. If you leave the input field empty, your name will be displayed as "Unknown".
The cards will be shuffled, and you can start playing by clicking on any card.
Click on two cards to flip them over.
If the symbols on the two flipped cards match, they will remain face up.
If the symbols on the two flipped cards do not match, they will be flipped back over after a short delay, and the number of tries will be incremented by one.
Continue flipping cards and matching pairs until all cards are matched.
The game ends when all cards are matched, and a success message will be displayed along with the number of tries you made.
